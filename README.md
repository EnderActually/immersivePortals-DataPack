# Immersive Portals Recreation

A datapack that recreates the feel of immersive portals and portal gun mechanics in vanilla Minecraft.  
This pack lets you create **Warp Portals** between locations and includes an **Portal Gun** 

This data pack is **Server Side**

## Warp Portals

Create Warp Portals between your favorite locations. This datapack is made to be balanced, simple to use and lightweight.
Warp Portals supports Multiplayer and uses the best practices for datapacks to ensure compatibility with other datapacks.
This datapack doesn't use chunk loading, unlike most teleportation datapacks, which makes it lightweight no matter how many portals you have.

### Forging the Portal Wand

To create a Warp Portal, you need to forge a Portal Wand. To do so, you need to drop an **Ender Pearl** in a **Crying Obsidian** block. They will turn into a portal and **and the Crying Obsidian will be the destination of the portal** created by the wand.

### Creating the Portal

To create a portal, you need to right-click above a **Crying Obsidian** block with the Portal Wand. The portal will be created and stepping into it will teleport you to the place where that Wand was forged. You can add more Crying Obsidian or Obsidian blocks around the portal to make it bigger, they will also teleport you when you step on them, you can use any shape, pads, rectangles, etc.

### Destroying the Portal

To destroy the portal, simply break the **Crying Obsidian** block in the entrance (where you see the particles) and the portal will be destroyed. **The Ender Pearl used to create the wand will drop above**.
